# Redux Documentation

## Introduction to Redux

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications. It is widely used for managing application state globally and is often paired with libraries such as React, Angular, or Vue.js. By centralizing application state, Redux ensures consistency across your application and simplifies state management.

## Core Principles of Redux

Redux operates on three fundamental principles:

1. **Single Source of Truth**: The state of the entire application is stored in an object tree within a single store.
2. **State is Read-Only**: The only way to change the state is to emit an action, which is an object describing what happened.
3. **Changes are Made with Pure Functions**: Reducers are pure functions that take the previous state and an action and return the next state.

## Folder Structure

The typical folder structure for a Redux project is organized by feature or function rather than file type. Here is a recommended structure:

```
/src
  /app
    - store.js
  /features
    /featureName
      - featureSlice.js
      - featureActions.js
      - featureReducer.js
      - featureSelectors.js
  /common
    /components
    /hooks
    /utils
```

Breaking down the key components:

- `store.js`: Creates the Redux store using the reducers defined in the application.
- `/features`: Contains all the specific features of the application. Each feature has its own directory, which includes:
  - `featureSlice.js`: Defines both actions and reducer for a feature using tools provided by Redux Toolkit (optional).
  - `featureActions.js`: Includes action creators for a feature.
  - `featureReducer.js`: Includes the reducer logic for handling actions.
  - `featureSelectors.js`: Contains selector functions to obtain slices of the state for React components.
- `/common`: Houses reusable components, custom hooks, and utility functions that might be shared across different features.

## Understanding Redux Concepts

### Actions

In Redux, actions are JavaScript objects that have a `type` field to describe how the state should change. Actions may also include a payload to carry data necessary for the update.

### Reducers

Reducers are pure functions that take the current state and an action, and return a new state. They are responsible for handling state transitions based on the type of action dispatched.

### Store

The store is an object that brings the actions and reducers together. It holds the application state, provides access to the state via `getState()`, allows state to be updated via `dispatch(action)`, and registers listeners via `subscribe(listener)`.

## Conclusion

Redux helps manage and update application state in a consistent and predictable manner, making it easier to understand, debug, and test the application. The modular organization of files based on features rather than roles aids in maintaining scalability and readability as applications grow in complexity.
